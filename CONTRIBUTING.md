# Coding Style

This SDK follows a coding style based on the [Airbnb conventions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). This repository uses `tslint` for linting the TypeScript code and `eslint` for linting the JavaScript test files. The rules for each are defined in `tslint.json` and `test/.eslintrc.js`, respectively. It is recommended that you do not change these files, since the automatically generated code complies with the defined rules.

You can run the linter with the following commands. Replacing “check” with “fix” will cause the linter to automatically fix any linting errors that it can.
- `npm run tslint:check`
- `npm run eslint:check`

# Running the Tests

SDK tests are organized into “unit” and “integration” tests, which live in `test/unit/` and `test/integration/`, respectively. Unit tests mock the request framework and test that request objects are constructed properly. Integration tests make requests to live service instances and test that the SDK works as intended from end to end.

This repository uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for its testing and mocking framework. To run individual test files, `jest` must be installed globally on your local machine. The aggregate tests are run with the following commands. The code coverage report is displayed by default.
- `npm run test` - run all tests
- `npm run test-unit` - run only unit tests
- `test-integration` - run only integration tests

### Unit tests
Unit tests are automatically generated to accompany each generated service code file. They rely on a set of utility functions contained in the file `test/resources/unitTestUtils.js`. **Virtually no set up is needed for unit tests, just put the generated test files in `test/unit/` and they will be ready to run.**

### Integration tests
Integration tests must be written by hand for each service, if desired. For integration tests to run, service credentials must be specified in a file called `test/resources/auth.js`.  An example showing the proper format of this file is located at `test/resources/auth.example.js`. 

An example integration test is located at `test/integration/integration.test.js.example`. This example contains the imports necessary to run an integration test suite, which will be explained below.

# Code Coverage

This repo uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to measure code coverage. To obtain a code coverage report, run `npm run test --coverage`
from the root of the project, and then view the coverage report.
